# Why Browser APIs?

Your browser isn't just a document viewer anymore — it's a **full application platform**.

## The Value Proposition aaa

| Traditional Approach | Browser APIs |
|---------------------|--------------|
| 💰 GPU servers & API costs | **Free** — runs on user's device |
| 🐌 Network latency (100-500ms) | **Instant** — local processing |
| 📡 Requires internet | **Offline-capable** |
| 🔧 Complex infrastructure | **Zero setup** — just ship HTML |
| 📦 App store approval | **Instant delivery** — click a link |

## What's Possible Today

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition** — Voice typing, transcription, commands
- 🎹 **Audio Processing** — DAWs, synthesizers, real-time effects
- 🎮 **Hardware Access** — Gamepads, MIDI, serial devices, USB
- 🖥️ **Window Management** — Multi-monitor layouts, fullscreen
- 📁 **File System** — Read/write local files with user permission

**Trade-off:** Less powerful than native, but surprisingly capable — and getting better every year.
